- Lecture Notes are the notes provided by course staff, file is named after its specific content for convenient look-up.
- Written Notes are the hand-written notes I took while listening to the lectures, include core derivations that are omitted during class time.
#### Supplement Material
For basic introduction to *matrix theory* (namely, how to differentiate a matrix function w.r.t. a matrix), read these two supplement materials, they are more detailed than some textbooks and theses:
- [basic differentiation w.r.t. matrices](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/273729929?utm_id=0)
- [differentiate w.r.t to determinants / matrix inverse]( https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/288541909?utm_id=0)
